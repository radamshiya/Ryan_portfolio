## Problem

The University of Washington’s MHCI+D program felt it was falling behind in preparing students to work with real-world applications of generative AI. While AI dominated the news cycle, students lacked clear, practical frameworks for understanding how these tools were actually being designed, evaluated, and used in industry.
<br><br>
Based on my prior sponsorship and mentorship work with the program, as well as my hands-on experience leading generative AI initiatives at Hiya, the university approached me to develop a workshop series to address this gap. I partnered with Sarah Outhwaite, a designer at Google working on generative AI products, to co-create and deliver the curriculum.

## Outcomes

- Workshop series adopted by the university as a full elective starting in 2026  
- Strong attendance and sustained student engagement across sessions  
- Reusable curriculum applied to internal teams at multiple companies  
- Led to additional speaking engagements and workshops at other universities  
- Established an ongoing feedback loop with students that refined teaching methods and perspectives on applied AI

## My Role

I served as co-instructor and curriculum designer, partnering closely with Sarah Othwaite to define the workshop structure, develop content and exercises, design hands-on activities, and deliver all sessions.

## Approach

We designed a three-part workshop series, with each session lasting three hours and delivered week over week. Ahead of the workshops, we spent roughly six weeks aligning on perspective and defining a clear foundation for teaching generative AI.

Given how broad and hype-driven the AI landscape had become, we intentionally scoped the curriculum to focus on generative AI as it is actually built and used in practice. We addressed media narratives directly, contrasted them with real adoption patterns, and used historical technology shifts to contextualize how unusually fast AI adoption has been.

Once that foundation was established, the workshops moved into practical application, including designing for AI, using AI within the design process, prompt design, usability testing, risk management, and the limitations of analogy and metaphor when describing AI systems.

Sessions were intentionally hands-on, prioritizing experimentation, discussion, and learning through practice rather than prescribing a single "right" way to work with AI.

## Findings

- Despite an abundance of online content, many people struggle to navigate AI due to distorted media narratives  
- Students and practitioners often need permission to experiment, explore, and be wrong more than instruction 
- Hands-on exposure rapidly builds confidence, even for participants with no prior AI experience  
- Treating AI as a design material rather than a feature or tool resonates strongly with researchers and designers
