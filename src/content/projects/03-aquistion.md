## Problem

After four years as an early employee at 10,000ft, the company was acquired by Smartsheet. Smartsheet wanted to integrate the two products immediately, but there was no clear strategy for how the products should work together or what the integration should enable for customers.
<br><br>
Complicating this further, there was no obvious shared object between the two platforms that made integration straightforward. Smartsheet and 10,000ft were often purchased by the same companies, but rarely used by the same teams—or even the same people. We needed to quickly understand how customers actually used both tools, where integration would add value, and where it could introduce unnecessary complexity.

## Outcomes

- Successfully launched the initial 10,000ft–Smartsheet product integration
- Drived meaningful post-acquisition revenue growth across the broader Smartsheet organization
- Enabled sales teams to confidently sell resource management alongside work management
- Clarified how and when customers should use each product together without redundancy
- Established a shared internal understanding of customer workflows across both platforms

## My Role

I partnered with the product director to define the research strategy, led all research operations and customer discovery, synthesized and shared insights across Smartsheet, worked closely with design to define integration constraints and user needs, and led extensive usability testing prior to launch.

## Approach

We began by deeply learning the Smartsheet product to understand its mental models, constraints, and value propositions. We then evaluated customer data to identify organizations using both platforms and worked to locate individuals who had exposure to both, which turned out to be relatively rare.
<br><br>
To reach these users, I identified geographic concentrations in areas like New York City and San Francisco and organized an in-person research roadshow. At each customer site (primarily design and advertising consultancies)we spent two to three hours with key stakeholders conducting detailed process-mapping sessions. We mapped how projects moved from inception to completion, where Smartsheet and 10,000ft fit into that flow, which tool projects originated in, and where information overlapped or diverged.
<br><br>
Alongside this, we worked with design and engineering to explore integration concepts and constraints. I partnered closely with the designer, running weekly usability studies to test prototypes and iterate quickly as solutions evolved.
<br><br>
We also conducted a broad internal education push, including an all-hands presentation I led for Smartsheet, sharing research findings and framing how customers actually thought about work, resourcing, and integration.

## Findings

- Resource management is closer to casting than staffing—customers prioritize nuanced skill sets and experience over roles or titles
- Customers sometimes intentionally keep tools out of sync, making control and flexibility more valuable than automation
- There was no single “right” direction for integration; customers needed the ability to move data both ways depending on where work originated
- Clear articulation of how two products complement each other is critical for successful cross-selling after an acquisition
