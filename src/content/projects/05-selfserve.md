## Problem

Hiya Connect was originally built as a sales-led offering. Customers could only access branded call services by going through a human-heavy sales process, and even after a console was created, it was still something customers were introduced to via a traditional sales cycle.

Internally, there was significant skepticism and resistance to the idea of self-service onboarding. Many stakeholders believed the process was “too complex to automate” due to compliance, verification, and configuration steps. Others doubted there was a meaningful audience of customers who would discover, sign up for, and successfully configure branded calling on their own.

We needed to validate whether a self-service channel was viable, understand what it would need to support, and design an experience that could handle the work previously done by humans—without compromising on compliance or customer success.

## Outcomes

- More than doubled first-year sales goals for the self-service channel 

- Sales goals for the channel were raised twice by the Chief Product Officer due to strong performance 

- More than doubled the number of active accounts within a year 

- Significantly reduced customer acquisition cost by enabling low-touch onboarding 

- Opened a path for smaller customers to start self-service and grow into larger accounts over time 

- Created a larger pool of opted-in leads we could continue to educate and nurture

## My Role

I led all research and strategy to prove that a self-service channel was both feasible and valuable. I mapped the existing end-to-end customer journey and jobs-to-be-done, facilitated cross-functional workshops, partnered with design on the new self-service journey, conducted usability testing with target customers, and designed the analytics needed to track funnel performance and identify friction points after launch.

## Approach

We started by interviewing stakeholders across the existing sales-led journey, speaking with each person involved at every handoff point. This gave us a detailed view of how onboarding actually worked in practice, including the invisible work teams were doing to compensate for system gaps.

In parallel, we ran our own “tear-down” of the current experience by going through the process as if we were new customers—from initial lead, to qualification, to console access. This helped us reconcile the internal view of the process with the customer perspective and identify gaps, bottlenecks, and redundant steps.

We then analyzed lead and account data to understand who was already coming to us, which segments were being turned away or stalled in the process, and where there was clear demand that the current model wasn’t serving well.

Using this combination of journey mapping and data, we partnered with design to identify which steps were redundant, which could be safely automated, and which required more thoughtful flows or clearer information architecture. This work produced a new end-to-end self-service journey for signing up, configuring, and activating branded calling.

Once we had a working sign-up flow, we conducted multiple rounds of usability testing—both with the University of Washington and through our own in-house research—focusing on ideal self-service customers. We iterated on copy, flow, and error states to reduce confusion and drop-off.

At launch, I implemented analytics to track key points in the funnel so we could see where customers slowed down, abandoned, or needed additional support. This instrumentation allowed us to quickly identify and address friction points as real customers moved through the new experience.

## Findings

- There was strong demand for self-service onboarding; we had been effectively turning away qualified customers at the door 
- Many prospective customers did not understand telecom or call center jargon, and needed simpler, more direct language to complete sign-up successfully 
- Compliance and “know your customer” steps created major drop-off risk when they were slow or opaque—speed, transparency, and clear expectations were critical 
- A well-designed self-service flow could maintain a high bar for verification while still feeling fast and respectful of the customer’s time 
- Clear journey mapping and data-backed results helped overcome internal skepticism and shift the organization toward a more scalable, product-led growth motion
